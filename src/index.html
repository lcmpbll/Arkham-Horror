              streets
              bustle with hover cars, traders and cargo trains taking parts, products and garbage to and from Central
              Robotics Development.Underneath the noise and bustle a series of mysterious disapperances have plagued the
              manufacturing hub. First Jim Grisswald, a robotics engineer, reported his youngest daughter Celia had gone
              missing. Then, Amy Sinclair reported her fianc√© never came home after a night of drinking with friends.
              One by one more disapperances piled up until one day a young cargo hauler found Celia's body on the edge of town at
              the dump. As a private investigator you've been hired to sort out what's really happening."</span></p>
