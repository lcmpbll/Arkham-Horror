          <p><span class="type" style="--n:1000">The town of Arkham hums with electricity. Holovid displays wash the night sky with neon colors. The streets bustle with hover cars, traders and cargo trains taking parts, products and garbage to and from Central Robotics Development. Underneath the noise and bustle a series of mysterious disapperances have plagued the manufacturing hub. First Jim Grisswald, a robotics engineer, reported his youngest daughter Celia had gone missing. Then, Amy Sinclair reported her fianc√© never came home after a night of drinking with friends. One by one more disapperances piled up until one day a young cargo hauler found Celia's body on the edge of town at the dump. As a private investigator you've been hired to sort out what's really happening.</span></p>
