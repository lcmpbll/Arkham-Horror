  <div class="story">
    <p>"The town of Arkham hums with electricity. Holovid displays wash the night sky with neon colors. The streets bustle with hover cars, traders and cargo trains taking parts, products and garbage to and from Central Robotics Development.Underneath the noise and bustle a series of mysterious disapperances have plagued the manufacturing hub. First Jim Grisswald, a robotics engineer, reported his youngest daughter Celia had gone missing. Then, Amy Sinclair reported her fianc√© never came home after a night of drinking with friends. One by one more disapperances piled up until one day a young cargo hauler found Celia's body on the edge of town at the dump. As a private investigator you've been hired to sort out what's really happening"</p>

    <p>Muddy footprints lead through the hallway towards a closed door. There are three other doors slightly ajar you can see stairs leading up through the attic door, stairs leading down through the cellar door, and some books and shelves in what appears to be the study.</p>

  <div class="cellar">
    <p>The stairs leading down to the cellar are covered in muddy fooprints. The cellar has a large hole in the wall, big enough for someone to squeeze through. You peek your head through the wall and see it leads into the city sewer system.</p>

  <div class="attic">
    <p>"You climb the ladder to the attic. The feeling of being watched paralyzes you before making it to the top of the ladder. For just a moment you think you can see the faint outline of a person in the corner. You notice a old dusty old laser gun is within reach of the opening to the attic."</p>
